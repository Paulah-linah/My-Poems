                I saw you,<BR>
                You smiled,<BR>
                I smiled back,<BR>
                You giggled,<BR>
                I giggled too,<BR>
                Call it a mimic,<BR>
                But i was lost in you,<BR>
                Get a grip i said,<BR>
                I couldn't stop,<BR>
                For this was all new.

                My world was all you,<BR>
                I didn't wanna screw it,<BR>
                All that mattered was you,<BR>
                You and you alone,<BR>
                That was enough.

            Have you ever heard of volcanoes,<BR>
            Powerfully destructive yet spew hot lava,<BR>
            I thought i found myself a lover,<BR>
            The whole me took a turn,<BR>

            Those were the days,<BR>
            For it was only a moment in time.
